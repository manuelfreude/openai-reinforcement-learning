### Deep deterministic policy gradient actor-critic model for Pendulum-v0 and Taxi-v2 environment
This is the first agent that will be created. Details about the background of the agent can be found here: 
http://pemami4911.github.io/blog/2016/08/21/ddpg-rl.html

In the provided example, the agent solves the Pendulum-v0 environment. I will modify the code so that it solves the Taxi-v2 environment including the respective performance score: best average reward. Target number is 9.7, if this is reached, the environment is considered as solved.
